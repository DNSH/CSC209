/*
6. [10 marks]
Write a C program to look at all files under the current directory, recursively, and look for a file named "squid".
If it finds one, it outputs either the path name relative to the current directory, or how many subdirectories deep it is, whichever you find easiest.
If no such file name is found, it outputs "not found".
